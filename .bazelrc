# For bazel-in-bazel testing
# Trick bazel into treating BUILD files under examples/* as being regular files
# This lets us glob() up all the files inside the examples to make them inputs to tests
# (Note, we cannot use `common --deleted_packages` because the bazel version command doesn't support it)
# To update these lines, run `bazel run @cgrindel_rules_bazel_integration_test//tools:update_deleted_packages`.
